# Galaga-1
My take on a Galaga type game (Java based)
This is a reverse enginered version of Kyle- baileys implementaion of Gala(Java Based)
Two classes added Boss and an Enum class to make weapons much easier to add. 
I also changed a few loops in the project if you want access to the original project .Check kyle-bailey's Galaga
